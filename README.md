# blog_api
This is a second attempt at a blog post api that was given to me as a job application assignment.

The original version was written in node.js and was not as successful as this one. Also that one took me about 4 days and this one took maybe 8 hours total.
The application is quite simple and could probably use some refactoring but I am satisfied with the outcome considering how little time it took.
